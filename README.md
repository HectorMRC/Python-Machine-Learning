# Python & Machine-Learning
Data analysis & machine learning in Python

# Motivation
This is a little project of Machine Learning that I made as final project for the JEDI course Python & Machine Learning organized by the UPC (Polytechnical University of Catalonia).

# Purpose
The main idea was to use a Solar-Radiation dataset get from Kaggle to train the machine and, with some terrestral local data (present in that DataSet), get how much solar radiation have fallen in there.
At meanwhile, that project was useful too for get me in the Python programming ambiroment and know much more about that language.
